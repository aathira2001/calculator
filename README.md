# calculator
Basic Calculator program using JAVA
This simple calculator is able to add,subtract,multiply and divide two numbers.
AWT(Abstract Window Toolkit) is an API that helps in building GUI (Graphical User Interface) based java applications. GUI helps in user interactions using some graphics. 
It primarily consists of a set of classes and methods that are required for creating and managing the GUI in a simplified manner such as buttons,windows,frame,textfield,RadioButton etc.
I have provided the Java code for the calculator which uses Action listener interface for EventHandling.
